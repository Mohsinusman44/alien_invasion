Alien Invasion is a comprehensive 2D arcade-style game developed using Python and the Pygame framework. 
This project serves as a practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, featuring a modular architecture that 
separates game logic, asset management, and configuration settings into distinct, maintainable classes. 
The game features real-time event handling for smooth player movement and projectile firing, automated enemy fleet behavior, and collision detection. 
By tracking progress through a Git-based workflow on GitHub, this project demonstrates a commitment 
to professional software development practices
, clean code standards, and iterative feature implementation.
